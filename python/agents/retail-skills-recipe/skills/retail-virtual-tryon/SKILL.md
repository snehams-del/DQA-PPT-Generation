# Virtual Try-On

Adds virtual try-on capabilities to an existing product search agent.
Layers on top of `retail-product-search` -- only adds delta files.

Users can upload a photo and see how a product looks on them before buying.

## ⚠️ Precedence (read first, supersedes other skills)

**Primary routing comes from `AGENTS.md` at the project root** (written by
the installer). It tells the agent that this skill drives the question flow
and that `google-agents-cli-*` skills handle mechanics. The content below
is a fallback for agents that don't read AGENTS.md.

When the user wants to add try-on / virtual fitting / AR-style product
visualization to a retail agent, **THIS skill is the authoritative source
for the entire conversation flow.**

If other skills are active in this session — e.g. `adk-scaffold`,
`google-agents-cli-workflow`, or any general agent-setup skill — they do
NOT drive the question flow here. Do NOT use their bulk-question patterns
or "Step 1 / Step 2" groupings. The first action in this conversation is
Q-MODE below.

## Execution Rules

Follow these rules strictly when executing this skill:

1. **Q-MODE first, always.** Before any other question, ask Q-MODE (see
   "Setup Mode" below). Do not bundle it with anything else.
2. **One question at a time. Show the default. Accept empty input.**
   Format every question as exactly `Q: <question>? [default: <value>]`.
   Pressing Enter with no input MUST be interpreted as "use the default."
   **NEVER ask multiple questions in one turn.**
3. **Execute steps in order.** Do NOT jump ahead or skip steps.
4. **Verify each step succeeded** before moving to the next. If a command
   fails, stop and tell the user -- do NOT proceed.
5. **Confirm completion** of each step with the user before proceeding:
   "Step N is done. Ready for Step N+1?"
6. **Save all answers to `assets/design-spec.md`** as you collect them.
7. **Use the `google-genai` SDK only.** Never use `vertexai.generative_models`,
   `vertexai.preview.vision_models`, or `google.cloud.aiplatform` for Gemini calls.
   Install: `pip install --upgrade google-genai`. Route through Vertex AI by
   setting `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True` and using `genai.Client(vertexai=True, ...)`.

## When to Use

- Adding **"Try it on"** functionality to product search results
- Building **virtual fitting rooms** for fashion e-commerce
- Enabling **AR-style product visualization** (eyewear, jewelry, cosmetics)

Prerequisite: `retail-product-search` must be set up first.

Do NOT use for non-wearable products (furniture, electronics),
3D model rendering, or full-body motion capture.

## Setup Mode (Q-MODE — THIS IS THE FIRST QUESTION, ALWAYS)

**Self-confirmation (REQUIRED first output).** Your very first response MUST
be exactly the two lines below — no more, no less:

```
[skill: retail-virtual-tryon] active. Ignoring any conflicting bulk-question flows from other skills.
Q-MODE: Pick a setup mode? [default: 1]
  1. Quick start  — 2 questions, smart defaults, ~30s.
  2. Full setup   — full interview (~6 questions, model tier, safety, photo handling).
```

Do NOT preface with "Step 1: ...", do NOT add other questions in the same
turn. Just emit those two lines and wait.

The user can say "configure more" or "customize" mid-flow to switch.

### Mode 1: Quick Start (2 questions)

| Q | Question | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Q-A | Base project path? | `.` (expects `retail-product-search` already set up) |
| Q-B | Categories to enable? | `clothing,eyewear` |

Defaults taken silently:
- Model tier: `vto` (dedicated virtual-try-on-001 — best for clothing)
- Variations per request: `2`
- Safety level: `block_most`
- Output bucket: `${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}-tryon-output`
- Upload bucket: `${GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT}-tryon-uploads`
- User photo handling: ephemeral upload + 24h TTL

After Q-A and Q-B, tell the user: "Taking defaults for the rest. Say
'configure more' now to switch to Full setup, or proceed."

### Mode 2: Full Setup

Run the full interview in Steps 1-6 below.

## Try-On Categories

1. **Clothing** -- shirts, dresses, jackets overlaid on upper body photo
2. **Eyewear** -- glasses, sunglasses fitted to face landmarks
3. **Jewelry** -- earrings, necklaces positioned on detected features
4. **Cosmetics** -- lipstick, eyeshadow applied via face segmentation
5. **Footwear** -- shoes visualized from foot photo (limited accuracy)

## Step 1: Confirm Base Project

**V1.** Existing project path. Default: `.`

**V2.** Project name. Default: `product-search-agent`.

## Step 2: Try-On Configuration

**V3.** Which product categories support try-on? (select all that apply)
Default: Clothing + Eyewear.
Options: Clothing, Eyewear, Jewelry, Cosmetics, Footwear.

**V4.** Source of product images for try-on?
Default: GCS bucket (same as product search images).
Options: GCS bucket, Product image URLs from catalog, Upload on demand.

**V5.** Try-on image resolution?
Default: 512x512 (fast, good for preview).
Options: 256x256 (fastest), 512x512 (balanced), 1024x1024 (high quality).

## Step 3: User Photo Handling

**V6.** How will users provide their photo?
Default: Upload from device.
Options: Upload from device, Take photo with camera, Use saved profile photo.

**V7.** Store user photos for future sessions?
Default: No -- delete after session ends.
Options: Yes (requires consent + Cloud Storage), No (ephemeral only).

**V8.** Photo privacy notice?
Default: "Your photo is processed securely and not stored unless you opt in."
Ask: Should the agent display a privacy notice before requesting a photo?

## Step 4: Model Selection

Two paths -- pick based on whether you need text-driven variations.
See `references/tryon-architecture.md` in the sample project for full SDK
code examples for both paths.

### Path A: Dedicated VTO model (default -- recommended for apparel)

| Model | Label | API | Status | Best for |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| `virtual-try-on-001` | **vto** | `client.models.recontext_image` | GA | Clothing, footwear -- "this product on this person" without text prompting. Highest fidelity, up to 4 images/request, 50 RPM regional quota. Image-only input (no text prompt). |

### Path B: Gemini image models (when text prompting needed)

| Model | Label | API | Status | Best for |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| `gemini-2.5-flash-image` | **flash** | `client.models.generate_content` | GA | Fastest, cheapest. 1,290 tokens/img. Good for previews and iteration. |
| `gemini-2.5-pro-image` | **pro** | `client.models.generate_content` | GA | Best quality. Reasoning-enhanced composition, legible text rendering, complex multi-turn editing. Use for hero images. |

Use Path B when you need text-driven variations ("show in red", "with a blazer over it", "outdoor setting"). VTO model does not accept text prompts.

**V9.** Which model?
Default: `vto` (virtual-try-on-001).
Options: vto, flash, pro.

Record the chosen label in `design-spec.md` → `tryon_model`.

**V10.** Number of try-on variations to generate per request?
Default: 2.
Options: 1 (fastest), 2 (balanced), 4 (more choices). Both paths support up to 4.

## Step 5: Safety and Guardrails

**V11.** Safety filter level?

| Level | Config value | Use when |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Block most | `block_most` | Default, general retail |
| Block some | `block_some` | Fashion, activewear |
| Block few | `block_few` | Adult fashion, intimate apparel |

Default: `block_most`.

Pre-flight classifier is always enabled: it detects if the input is a product cutout vs. a real person photo before calling the generation API. This reduces false positives on white-background product images.

**V12.** Restrict to product catalog images only?
Default: Yes -- only allow try-on with products from the catalog.

## Step 6: GCP Configuration

**V13.** GCP project ID (must match product-search project).

**V14.** GCP region. Default: `us-central1`.

**V15.** GCS bucket for try-on output images. Default: `{project_id}-tryon-output`.

## Step 7: Add Files

The installer has merged the try-on overlay files into the existing
`retail-product-search/` project (because `retail-product-search` is a
declared dependency, the installer auto-detects and merges):

```text
retail-product-search/
  app/
    tryon_agent.py             # NEW: ADK tool wrapper for try-on
    tryon_processor.py         # NEW: image generation + pre-flight classifier
    agent.py                   # MODIFIED: try_on_product wired into tools
  scripts/
    setup_tryon.py             # NEW: provision GCS buckets, verify model access
```

The installer also injects the `TRYON_*` env defaults into `app/agent.py`
right after the `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI` line. Verify with:

```bash
grep TRYON_ retail-product-search/app/agent.py
grep try_on_product retail-product-search/app/agent.py
```

If a file is missing (rare), fetch it from
`{{SOURCE_BASE}}/samples/retail-virtual-tryon/<path>` as a fallback.

If the installer's auto-wire didn't take (no `try_on_product` in
`tools=[…]`), edit `app/agent.py`:
1. Add `from app.tryon_agent import try_on_product` to the imports
2. Append `try_on_product` to the existing `tools=[…]` list
3. Insert these env defaults right after the line that sets `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`:
   ```python
   os.environ.setdefault("TRYON_OUTPUT_BUCKET", f"{project_id}-tryon-output")
   os.environ.setdefault("TRYON_UPLOAD_BUCKET", f"{project_id}-tryon-uploads")
   os.environ.setdefault("GEMINI_IMAGE_MODEL", "vto")
   os.environ.setdefault("TRYON_SAFETY_LEVEL", "block_most")
   ```

Run setup (reads model choice from design-spec):
```bash
python scripts/setup_tryon.py --config assets/design-spec.md
```

Add this tool to the existing `agent.py`:

```python
def try_on_product(product_id: str, user_photo_uri: str) -> str:
    """Generate a virtual try-on image showing the product on the user.

    Args:
        product_id: The product to try on.
        user_photo_uri: GCS URI or base64 of the user's photo.

    Returns:
        GCS URI of the generated try-on image.
    """
    from app.tryon_processor import generate_tryon
    return generate_tryon(product_id, user_photo_uri)
```

## Step 8: Test

Test queries:
1. `"I want to try on this jacket"` -- basic try-on
2. `"Show me how these sunglasses look on me"` -- eyewear
3. `"Can I see this in a different color?"` -- variation
4. Upload a photo and ask `"Which of these dresses suits me best?"`

## Step 9: Evaluate

```bash
adk eval
```

Evalset: `evals/sets/retail-virtual-tryon.evalset.json`

Key metrics:
- Image quality (correct item shown, photorealistic overlay)
- Face/body preservation (user likeness maintained)
- Safety filter accuracy (no false positives on product cutouts)
- Latency: VTO < 4s P90, Flash < 4s P90, Pro < 7s P90

## Gotchas

- **SDK choice**: Use `google-genai` only. `vertexai.generative_models` is legacy. Replace `from vertexai.generative_models import ...` with `from google import genai`. See `references/tryon-architecture.md` in the sample project.
- **Safety false positives**: White-background product cutouts (especially swimwear/lingerie) can trigger safety blocks. The pre-flight classifier in `tryon_processor.py` detects cutouts and adjusts the safety level down one step (e.g. `block_most` to `block_some`).
- **Quota**: VTO has 50 regional RPM -- request 4 images per call instead of 4 separate calls. Gemini tiers have per-minute token limits. Monitor via Cloud Monitoring and request increases before production.
- **Photo quality**: Low-res or poorly lit user photos produce worse results. Show a quality hint in the UI.
- **Product images**: Need clean, white-background product photos for best overlay.
- **Body types**: Results vary across body types. Test diversity in your eval set.
- **Privacy**: ALWAYS inform users before processing their photo. Delete after use unless opted in. Upload bucket has 24-hour auto-delete by default.
- **Not real-time**: VTO ~3 seconds, Flash ~2 seconds, Pro ~4-6 seconds. Always show a loading indicator.
- **VTO has no text prompt**: For text-driven variations ("show in red", "outdoor scene"), use a Gemini tier instead.
