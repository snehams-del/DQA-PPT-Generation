# Product Search Agent

## Overview

This design spec captures the configuration decisions for a retail product search
agent built on Google Cloud. It is generated during the SKILL.md interview and
used by ingestion scripts and agent scaffolding.

## How to Use

1. Fill in the YAML frontmatter above (or let the coding agent do it conversationally)
2. Pass this file to any script: `python scripts/ingest_bigquery.py --config design-spec.md`
3. CLI args always override values from this file

## Design Decisions

Document any non-obvious choices here so future contributors understand the "why".
