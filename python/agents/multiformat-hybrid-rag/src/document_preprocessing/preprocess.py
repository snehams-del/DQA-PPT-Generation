"""Preprocess step: detect new/changed files in GCS and extract text.

Detects which files are new or changed by comparing the BQ Object Table
(metadata mirror of the GCS bucket) against our `preprocessed` table,
then dispatches text extraction in parallel directly to the Cloud Run
service via authenticated HTTP — no BQ remote function involved.

Why not BQ remote functions:
    The original design used a BQ REMOTE FUNCTION wrapping the Cloud Run
    service. BQ allocates parallelism based on data size, so for small
    inputs (~1k rows) it serializes calls onto a single slot, blocking
    that slot for the entire HTTP round-trip. With ~30s/file Gemini
    latency, 1k files took 6+ hours. Calling Cloud Run directly with a
    Python ThreadPoolExecutor gives us deterministic N-way parallelism
    and lets Cloud Run's own autoscaler do its job.

Change detection:
    Object Table LEFT JOIN preprocessed
    - New files:     prep.file_id IS NULL
    - Changed files: obj.md5_hash != prep.content_hash

Content dedup (two layers):
    - Cross-run: same md5_hash already extracted? Reference that file_id.
    - Within-run: multiple URIs share md5_hash this batch? Pick the
      lowest URI; the rest reference the picked file_id.
    Both produce stub rows (content='', error='duplicate_of:<id>') that
    satisfy the change-detection WHERE clause on later runs.

Identity:
    file_id = MD5(gcs_uri) — stable across content changes, tied to the
    file's location rather than its contents.

Supported file types:
    PDF, DOCX, DOC, PPTX, PPT, XLSX, XLS, RTF, HTML, Markdown, plain text.
