"""Shared HTTP helpers for the orchestrator → Cloud Run service fanouts.

Both `src.document_preprocessing.preprocess` and
`src.chunking.chunk_and_index` dispatch one HTTP request per file
to a Cloud Run service via `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Cloud Run can return
HTTP 500 "no available instance" during cold-start bursts when the
orchestrator dispatches faster than the autoscaler can spin up
containers. Those responses come back with `latency=0` and never reach
the app — retrying after a short sleep almost always succeeds because
by then a new instance is ready.
