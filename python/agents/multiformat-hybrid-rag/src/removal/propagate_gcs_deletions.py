"""Cleanup step: detect deleted files and cascade-remove from BQ and VS2.

This step reconciles the pipeline state against the GCS bucket to handle
file deletions. Since GCS doesn't emit real-time delete events that we
subscribe to, we detect deletions via a batch comparison:

    preprocessed LEFT JOIN Object Table WHERE obj.uri IS NULL

Any file that exists in our preprocessed table but no longer appears
in the Object Table (i.e., was deleted from GCS) gets cleaned up.

Cascade delete order:
    1. VS2 chunks data objects (semantic search index)
    2. VS2 documents data objects (per-file_id KV store)
    3. BQ chunks table (chunk-level metadata)
    4. BQ preprocessed table (file-level metadata)

This order is intentional — if the process crashes mid-way, a re-run
will pick up the remaining deletions because the preprocessed row
(checked in step 1's query) is deleted last.

Can be called from scripts or imported into a Vertex AI Pipeline component.

    Main entry point, called by the Vertex AI Pipeline cleanup
    component. It performs:

    1. **Detect** — Query BQ to find files in the preprocessed table
       that no longer exist in the GCS Object Table.
    2. **Cascade delete** — For each deleted file, remove its data
       from all downstream stores in safe order:
       a. VS2 chunks data objects (query by file_id, batch delete)
       b. VS2 documents data objects (point delete by file_id)
       c. BQ chunks table rows (DELETE WHERE file_id IN ...)
       d. BQ preprocessed table rows (DELETE WHERE file_id IN ...)

    The cascade order ensures idempotency: if the process fails after
    deleting from VS2 but before deleting from BQ, the next run will
    still find the file in preprocessed (since it's deleted last) and
    retry the full cascade.

    Args:
        bq_client: Authenticated BigQuery client.
        collection_path: Full VS2 chunks collection resource path.
        documents_collection_path: Full VS2 documents-by-file_id collection path.
        fq_object_table: Fully-qualified BQ Object Table name.
        fq_preprocessed_table: Fully-qualified BQ preprocessed table name.
        fq_chunks_table: Fully-qualified BQ chunks table name.
