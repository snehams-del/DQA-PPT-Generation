"""Chunk-and-index step: split preprocessed text into chunks and ingest into VS2.

This is the second stage of the two-stage ingestion pipeline. It takes the
already-extracted text from the BQ preprocessed table and dispatches one
HTTP request per file to the `chunk-index` Cloud Run service. The service
splits the text, generates contextual chunks via Gemini, and indexes them
into both Vector Search 2.0 collections (chunks + documents). On successful
response, the orchestrator inserts the returned chunk rows into the BQ
chunks table with `indexed_at` set.

Why no BigFrames / BQ remote function:
    BigQuery dispatches REMOTE FUNCTION calls based on slot allocation
    (data-size proportional), capping us at ~20 instances even on 1k rows.
    Direct HTTP fanout from the orchestrator gives deterministic N-way
    parallelism and lets Cloud Run's autoscaler do its job.

Chunk identity:
    chunk_id = "{file_id}__{chunk_index}"
    Deterministic given the same file content and chunk parameters. When
    a file is re-chunked, the service first deletes the old VS2 entries
    for this file_id; the orchestrator deletes old BQ chunks before
    inserting the new ones.

VS2 auto-embeddings:
    Data objects are created with empty vectors — VS 2.0 auto-generates
    embeddings using the configured model and the collection's text_template.
