"""KFP component: Preprocess — detect new/changed files and extract text.

This is a thin KFP wrapper around the shared pipeline.document_preprocessing
module. The @component decorator serializes this function into a self-contained
container step that Vertex AI Pipelines can schedule and execute independently.

All heavy logic (change detection via BQ Object Table, text extraction via
parallel HTTP fanout to the preprocess Cloud Run service, MERGE into BQ)
lives in the shared pipeline/ package.

# The @component decorator tells KFP to run this function inside the

# ephemeral Python script that the container executes — so imports must
# live inside the function (they resolve at runtime inside the container,
# not at compile time on the submitting machine).

    """Detect new/changed files in GCS and extract text to BQ.

    How it works:
    1. Queries the BQ Object Table (external table linked to GCS) and
       LEFT JOINs against the preprocessed table to find files that are
       new (not in preprocessed) or changed (different content_hash),
       and to spot content duplicates (cross-run + within-run).
    2. Dispatches non-duplicate URIs in parallel to the Cloud Run
       preprocess service (LibreOffice + Gemini) via authenticated HTTP.
    3. MERGEs extracted rows + duplicate stubs into the preprocessed
       table (upsert).

    Args:
        project_id: GCP project ID.
        region: GCP region (for BQ client).
        gcs_prefix: Prefix within the bucket (e.g. "documents/").
        fq_object_table: Fully-qualified BQ Object Table name
                         (e.g. "project.dataset.gcs_objects").
        fq_preprocessed_table: Fully-qualified BQ preprocessed table name
                               (e.g. "project.dataset.preprocessed").

    Returns:
        Number of files preprocessed (0 if nothing changed).
