"""KFP component: Cleanup — detect deleted files and cascade-remove.

Handles the reverse of ingestion: when a file is removed from the GCS
source bucket, this step detects it and cascade-deletes all derived data
(VS2 data objects, BQ chunks, BQ preprocessed row).

Deletion order is important for idempotency:
  1. Delete from VS2 first (search index)
  2. Delete from BQ chunks table
  3. Delete from BQ preprocessed table
If the step fails partway through and retries, the already-deleted
resources are simply no-ops, so no data is left dangling.

All logic lives in the shared pipeline/ package.

    """Detect files deleted from GCS and cascade-remove from BQ + VS2.

    How it works:
    1. Queries the BQ Object Table (live GCS metadata) and compares
       against the preprocessed table to find "orphaned" files — rows
       in preprocessed that no longer have a corresponding GCS object.
    2. For each orphaned file_id:
       a. Deletes all data objects from VS2 (by file_id filter)
       b. Deletes all rows from the chunks table (WHERE file_id = ...)
       c. Deletes the row from the preprocessed table
    3. Returns the count of cleaned-up files.

    This step is conditional — it only runs when skip_cleanup=False
    in the pipeline DAG (controlled by dsl.Condition in pipeline.py).

    Args:
        project_id: GCP project ID.
        region: GCP region (must match BQ dataset and VS2 collection).
        vs_collection_id: VS2 chunks collection ID.
        vs_documents_collection_id: VS2 documents-by-file_id collection ID.
        fq_object_table: Fully-qualified BQ Object Table name. This is
                         an external table backed by GCS — it reflects
                         the live state of the bucket.
        fq_preprocessed_table: Fully-qualified BQ preprocessed table name.
        fq_chunks_table: Fully-qualified BQ chunks table name.

    Returns:
        Number of files cleaned up (0 if no deletions detected).
