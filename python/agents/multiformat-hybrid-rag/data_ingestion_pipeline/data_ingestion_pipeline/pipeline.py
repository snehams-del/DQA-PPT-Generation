"""KFP pipeline definition for the GCS-based RAG ingestion pipeline.

Defines a three-stage Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that KFP compiles
into a JSON pipeline spec and submits to Vertex AI Pipelines:

    preprocess ──► chunk_and_index ──► cleanup (conditional)

Each stage is a separate container step running the Docker image from
Artifact Registry. Stages execute sequentially (enforced by .after()),
and each has automatic retries (up to 2) for transient failures.

This file only defines the DAG wiring and parameter passing — all
business logic lives in the shared pipeline/ package, which the
KFP components import at runtime inside their containers.

Run via `make data-ingestion-remote` (submits to Vertex AI Pipelines).
