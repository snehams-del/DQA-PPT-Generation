# Preprocessing Cloud Run service.
#
# A Docker image with LibreOffice + Gemini SDK that extracts text and
# classifies relevance for a single GCS file per request. The pipeline
# orchestrator dispatches files in parallel via authenticated HTTP — no
# BQ remote function in the loop.
#
# Architecture:
#   Pipeline orchestrator (ThreadPoolExecutor, N workers)
#     → Cloud Run (autoscales, LibreOffice + Gemini per instance)
#     → JSON result back to orchestrator → MERGE into BQ.
#
# Why no BQ remote function: BQ assigns parallelism by data size, so for
# small inputs it serializes calls onto a single slot, blocking that slot
# for the entire HTTP round-trip. Direct fanout from the orchestrator
# gives deterministic N-way parallelism.
