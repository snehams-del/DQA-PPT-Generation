"""Integration tests for Phase 2 components: Interview Coach and Career Strategy Advisor.

These tests verify that:
1. Phase 2 sub-agents are properly wired to the Career Coordinator
2. State flows correctly between all agents (Phase 1 + Phase 2)
3. The complete end-to-end workflow executes (profile → research → application → interview prep → strategy)
4. Error handling works across all agent boundaries
